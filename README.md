# LLM-Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI applications.  
The goal of this repo is to experiment with different AI models, frameworks, and techniques while building a personal portfolio of applied projects.

Projects in this repo will cover:
- Practical AI assistants for real-world use cases  
- Explorations of model integration, APIs, and modern AI tooling  

Each project is organized in its own folder with notebooks, code, and documentation.  

This is a work in progress and will be continuously updated as I explore new tools and techniques in the LLM and generative AI space.


## Setup `.env` file

1. In the root of the repository, create a new text file using Notepad (or any text editor).
2. Add your API keys in the following format:
   
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```

4. Save  the file with the name: `.env`
   **Important:** In the "Save as type" dropdown, select All Files (not `.txt`).
   
5. The project will automatically load these keys when running the notebooks.

**Note:** Do not share your `.env` file publicly. It is ignored by GitHub via `.gitignore`.
