# LLM-Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI applications.  
The goal of this repo is to experiment with different AI models, frameworks, and techniques while building a personal portfolio of applied projects.

Projects in this repo will cover:
- Practical AI assistants for real-world use cases  
- Explorations of model integration, APIs, and modern AI tooling  

Each project is organized in its own folder with notebooks, code, and documentation.  

This is a work in progress and will be continuously updated as I explore new tools and techniques in the LLM and generative AI space.
